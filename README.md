# Python project template
No matter what kind of project you plan to do (Django/Flask web app or pure-python CLI tool) the Python project template brings you the best practices in code style, code quality, and automation.  
Enjoy the development of your new project :beach_umbrella:

## Features
* Automated with `make` development environment:
  * Creating virtualenv
  * Installing requirements
  * Code-style checking with `isort` and `black`
  * Linting with `prospector` (`mypy`, `pylint`, `pycodestyle`, `Pyflakes`, `Mccabe`, `Dodgy`, `Pydocstyle`, `bandit`)
  * Unit testing
  * Coverage checking
  * Docker Compose up/down
  * Running the app  
  * Cleaning up workdir
* GitHub Actions workflow
* Dockerfile & docker-compose

## Pre-requirements
* It's usually good idea to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) version **1.2.0** or higher 

## Usage
* Use the repo as a GitHub template OR:
  * Clone the repo.
  * Change git origin to your new git repo. 
* Run `make` for the help message.

For example `make check` will do:
* create virtualenv (if it doesn't created yet)
* install requirements (if it doesn't installed yet)
* install dev requirements (if it doesn't installed yet)
* run `isort --check --diff`
* run `black --check --diff`
* run `prospector`
* run `mypy`
* run unit tests

GitHub Actions use the same (`make check`) command to check pull requests 

## ToDo

* Pre-commit hook
